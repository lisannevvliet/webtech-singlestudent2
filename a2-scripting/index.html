            <h2>Types of musicals</h2>
            <dl>
                <dt><strong>Book musicals</strong></dt>
                <dd>Book musicals are perhaps the most traditional form of musical theatre, featuring a clear narrative structure with the songs and dances advancing the plot and character development. Examples of book musicals include classics such as <em>West Side Story</em> and <em>The Sound of Music</em>, as well as more recent hits like <em>Hamilton</em> and <em>Dear Evan Hansen</em>.</dd>
                <dt><strong>Jukebox musicals</strong></dt>
                <dd>Jukebox musicals are built around pre&#8209;existing songs, often from a particular artist or era. Examples of jukebox musicals include <em>Mamma Mia!</em> which features the music of ABBA, and <em>Jersey Boys</em>, which tells the story of Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons. The best of this type of musical is <em>Beautiful: The Carole King Musical</em>, which tells the story of the legendary singer&#8209;songwriter and features many of her hit songs.</dd>
                <dt><strong>Revue musicals</strong></dt>
                <dd>Revue musicals are collections of loosely connected musical numbers, often with a specific theme. The best example of this type of musical is <em>Ain't Misbehavin'</em>, which celebrates the music of Fats Waller and the Harlem Renaissance.</dd>
                <dt><strong>Rock musicals</strong></dt>
                <dd>Rock musicals feature a rock music score, often with edgier themes and subject matter. Examples of rock musicals include <em>Rent</em>, which explores the lives of struggling artists in New York City, and <em>Spring Awakening</em>, which deals with adolescent sexuality and rebellion. The best of this type of musical is <em>Jesus Christ Superstar</em>, which tells the story of the last week of Jesus' life and features a classic rock score by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice.</dd>
                <dt><strong>Concept musicals</strong></dt>
                <dd>Concept musicals are built around a central idea or concept, often with a more experimental structure. The best example of this type of musical is <em>Company</em>, which explores the complexities of modern relationships through a series of vignettes.</dd>
                <dt><strong>Operettas</strong></dt>
                <dd>Operettas are lighter, more comedic musicals with a focus on music and dancing. The best example of this type of musical is <em>The Pirates of Penzance</em>, which tells the story of a young pirate apprentice and features catchy tunes and witty lyrics.</dd>
                <dt><strong>Pastiche musicals</strong></dt>
                <dd>Pastiche musicals borrow from different styles and genres, often with a more tongue&#8209;in&#8209;cheek tone. Examples of pastiche musicals include <em>The Drowsy Chaperone</em>, which pokes fun at traditional musical theatre tropes, and <em>Spamalot</em>, which parodies the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. The best of this type of musical is <em>Crazy For You</em>, which pays homage to the classic Broadway musicals of the 1930s with its toe&#8209;tapping tunes and dazzling choreography.</dd>
                <dt><strong>Disney&#8209;style musicals</strong></dt>
                <dd>Disney&#8209;style musicals are family&#8209;friendly and often based on animated films. Examples of Disney&#8209;style musicals include <em>The Lion King</em>, <em>Aladdin</em>, and <em>Frozen</em>. The best of this type of musical is <em>Beauty and the Beast</em>, which brings the beloved animated film to life with its stunning sets, memorable songs, and enchanting story.</dd>
